Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found\na yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation\ncompanies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing\ninto the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they\nwanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and\nfurry coats to protect them from the frost.\nBuck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.\nJudge Miller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half\nhidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of\nthe wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was\napproached by gravelled driveways which wound about through\nwide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall\npoplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than\nat the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and\nboys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants' cottages, an endless and\norderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures,\norchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for\nthe artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller's boys\ntook their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.", "metadata": {"source": "The_Call_of_the_Wild-Jack_London.pdf", "page": 3}}

They came and went, resided in the populous\nkennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the\nfashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,\n—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to\nground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of\nthem at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel\nlooking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of\nhousemaids armed with brooms and mops.\nBut Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm\nwas his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the\nJudge's sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters,\non long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at\nthe Judge's feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge's\ngrandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their\nfootsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable\nyard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry\npatches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and\nYsabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping,\ncrawling, flying things of Judge Miller's place, humans included.\nHis father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge's\ninseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his\nfather. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty\npounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog.\nNevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added\nthe dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled\nhim to carry himself in right royal fashion.

He loved to play\nChinese lottery. Also, in his gambling, he had one besetting\nweakness—faith in a system; and this made his damnation certain.\nFor to play a system requires money, while the wages of a\ngardener's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous\nprogeny.\nThe Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers' Association,\nand the boys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the\nmemorable night of Manuel's treachery.

To be sure, it was\nan unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he\nknew, and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own.\nBut when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands,\nhe growled menacingly. He had merely intimated his displeasure, in\nhis pride believing that to intimate was to command. But to his\nsurprise the rope tightened around his neck, shutting off his breath.\nIn quick rage he sprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled\nhim close by the throat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his\nback.

They only laughed and\npoked sticks at him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he\nrealized that that was what they wanted. Whereupon he lay down\nsullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon. Then he, and\nthe crate in which he was imprisoned, began a passage through\nmany hands.

His eyes turned blood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a\nraging fiend. So changed was he that the Judge himself would not\nhave recognized him; and the express messengers breathed with\nrelief when they bundled him off the train at Seattle.\nFour men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,\nhigh-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged\ngenerously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.\nThat was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled\nhimself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and\nbrought a hatchet and a club.\n\"You ain't going to take him out now?\" the driver asked.\n\"Sure,\" the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.\nThere was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had\ncarried it in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to\nwatch the performance.\nBuck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it,\nsurging and wrestling with it.

Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful\nblow on the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing\ncompared with the exquisite agony of this.

The facts of life took on a\nfiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it\nwith all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went\nby, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some\ndocilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and\nall, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red\nsweater. Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance,\nthe lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a\nlawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated.\nOf this last Buck was never guilty, though he did see beaten dogs\nthat fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his\nhand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey,\nfinally killed in the struggle for mastery.\nNow and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly,\nwheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red\nsweater.

Perrault was a French-Canadian,\nand swarthy; but Francois was a French-Canadian half-breed, and\ntwice as swarthy. They were a new kind of men to Buck (of which he\nwas destined to see many more), and while he developed no\naffection for them, he none the less grew honestly to respect them.\nHe speedily learned that Perrault and Francois were fair men, calm\nand impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the way of\ndogs to be fooled by dogs.\nIn the 'tween-decks of the Narwhal, Buck and Curly joined two\nother dogs.

Sons of the one\nmother though they were, they were as different as day and night.\nBillee's one fault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the\nvery opposite, sour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a\nmalignant eye. Buck received them in comradely fashion, Dave\nignored them, while Spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the\nother. Billee wagged his tail appeasingly, turned to run when he saw\nthat appeasement was of no avail, and cried (still appeasingly) when\nSpitz's sharp teeth scored his flank. But no matter how Spitz circled,\nJoe whirled around on his heels to face him, mane bristling, ears laid\nback, lips writhing and snarling, jaws clipping together as fast as he\ncould snap, and eyes diabolically gleaming—the incarnation of\nbelligerent fear. So terrible was his appearance that Spitz was forced\nto forego disciplining him; but to cover his own discomfiture he\nturned upon the inoffensive and wailing Billee and drove him to the\nconfines of the camp.\nBy evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and\nlean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which\nflashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was\ncalled Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked\nnothing, gave nothing, expected nothing; and when he marched\nslowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He\nhad one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He\ndid not like to be approached on his blind side.

To remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did\nhunger compel him, he was not above taking what did not belong to\nhim. He watched and learned.

Its wild water defied the\nfrost, and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice\nheld at all. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those\nthirty terrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was\naccomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times,\nPerrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved\nby the long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time\nacross the hole made by his body. But a cold snap was on, the\nthermometer registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke\nthrough he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his\ngarments.\nNothing daunted him.

Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in\nleadership. It was none of their business. Their business was to toil,\nand toil mightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered\nwith, they did not care what happened. Billee, the good-natured,\ncould lead for all they cared, so long as he kept order. The rest of the\nteam, however, had grown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and\ntheir surprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick them into\nshape.\nPike, who pulled at Buck's heels, and who never put an ounce\nmore of his weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to\ndo, was swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first\nday was done he was pulling more than ever before in his life. The\nfirst night in camp, Joe, the sour one, was punished roundly— a\nthing that Spitz had never succeeded in doing. Buck simply\nsmothered him by virtue of superior weight, and cut him up till he\nceased snapping and began to whine for mercy.\nThe general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered\nits old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in\nthe traces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona,\nwere added; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took\naway Francois's breath.\n\"Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!\" he cried. \"No, nevaire!

His comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart\nthrough being denied the work that killed it, and recalled instances\nthey had known, where dogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died\nbecause they were cut out of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy,\nsince Dave was to die anyway, that he should die in the traces,\nheart-easy and content.

It was not the dead-\ntiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort, from which\nrecovery is a matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that\ncomes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months\nof toil. There was no power of recuperation left, no reserve strength\nto call upon. It had been all used, the last least bit of it. Every\nmuscle, every fibre, every cell, was tired, dead tired.

But so many were the men who had rushed into the\nKlondike, and so many were the sweethearts, wives, and kin that\nhad not rushed in, that the congested mail was taking on Alpine\nproportions; also, there were official orders. Fresh batches of\nHudson Bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the\ntrail. The worthless ones were to be got rid of, and, since dogs count\nfor little against dollars, they were to be sold.\nThree days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how\nreally tired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth\nday, two men from the States came along and bought them, harness\nand all, for a song. The men addressed each other as \"Hal\" and\n\"Charles.\" Charles was a middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with\nweak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and\nvigorously up, giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed.\nHal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty, with a big Colt's revolver\nand a hunting-knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled\nwith cartridges.

They did not take kindly to trace and trail. With the\nexception of the two mongrels, they were bewildered and spirit-\nbroken by the strange savage environment in which they found\nthemselves and by the ill treatment they had received.

And on no day did they succeed in\nmaking more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in\ntheir dog-food computation.\nIt was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they\nhastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when\nunderfeeding would commence. The Outside dogs, whose\ndigestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most\nof little, had voracious appetites. And when, in addition to this, the\nworn- out huskies pulled weakly, Hal decided that the orthodox ration\nwas too small. He doubled it. And to cap it all, when Mercedes, with\ntears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat, could not cajole\nhim into giving the dogs still more, she stole from the fish-sacks and\nfed them slyly. But it was not food that Buck and the huskies needed,\nbut rest. And though they were making poor time, the heavy load\nthey dragged sapped their strength severely.\nThen came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that\nhis dog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered;\nfurther, that for love or money no additional dog-food was to be\nobtained. So he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to\nincrease the day's travel.

Many\nmen had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there were\nwho had never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped\nin tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man.\nThe oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From the\nbeginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying\nmen had sworn to it, and to the mine the site of which it marked,\nclinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known\ngrade of gold in the Northland.\nBut no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead\nwere dead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck\nand half a dozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail\nto achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed.\nThey sledded seventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the\nStewart River, passed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on\nuntil the Stewart itself became a streamlet, threading the upstanding\npeaks which marked the backbone of the continent.\nJohn Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of\nthe wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the\nwilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased.\nBeing in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course\nof the day's travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept\non travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would\ncome to it.

He was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged\nhimself, an arrow protruding, head and feathers, from either side of\nhis body.\nA hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs\nThornton had bought in Dawson.

At the same instant Buck peered out where\nthe spruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap\nstraight up on his neck and shoulders. A gust of overpowering rage\nswept over him. He did not know that he growled, but he growled\naloud with a terrible ferocity. For the last time in his life he allowed\npassion to usurp cunning and reason, and it was because of his\ngreat love for John Thornton that he lost his head.\nThe Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-\nbough lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon\nthem an animal the like of which they had never seen before. It was\nBuck, a live hurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy\nto destroy. He sprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the\nYeehats), ripping the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a\nfountain of blood. He did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in\npassing, with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second\nman. There was no withstanding him. He plunged about in their very\nmidst, tearing, rending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion\nwhich defied the arrows they discharged at him. In fact, so\ninconceivably rapid were his movements, and so closely were the\nIndians tangled together, that they shot one another with the arrows;\nand one young hunter, hurling a spear at Buck in mid air, drove it\nthrough the chest of another hunter with such force that the point\nbroke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond. Then a\npanic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to the woods,\nproclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.\nAnd truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and\ndragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was\na fateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the\ncountry, and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors\ngathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses.

Death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and\naway from the lives of the living, he knew, and he knew John\nThornton was dead. It left a great void in him, somewhat akin to\nhunger, but a void which ached and ached, and which food could not\nfill, At times, when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the\nYeehats, he forgot the pain of it; and at such times he was aware of\na great pride in himself,—a pride greater than any he had yet\nexperienced. He had killed man, the noblest game of all, and he had\nkilled in the face of the law of club and fang. He sniffed the bodies\ncuriously. They had died so easily. It was harder to kill a husky dog\nthan them. They were no match at all, were it not for their arrows and\nspears and clubs. Thenceforward he would be unafraid of them\nexcept when they bore in their hands their arrows, spears, and clubs.\nNight came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the\nsky, lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the\ncoming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck\nbecame alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that\nwhich the Yeehats had made, He stood up, listening and scenting.\nFrom far away drifted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of\nsimilar sharp yelps. As the moments passed the yelps grew closer\nand louder. Again Buck knew them as things heard in that other\nworld which persisted in his memory. He walked to the centre of the\nopen space and listened. It was the call, the many- noted call,\nsounding more luringly and compellingly than ever before. And as\nnever before, he was ready to obey. John Thornton was dead. The\nlast tie was broken.

Three others tried it in sharp succession; and one after\nthe other they drew back, streaming blood from slashed throats or\nshoulders.\nThis was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell,\ncrowded together, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull\ndown the prey. Buck's marvellous quickness and agility stood him in\ngood stead. Pivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he\nwas everywhere at once, presenting a front which was apparently\nunbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side. But to\nprevent them from getting behind him, he was forced back, down\npast the pool and into the creek bed, till he brought up against a high\ngravel bank. He worked along to a right angle in the bank which the\nmen had made in the course of mining, and in this angle he came to\nbay, protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the\nfront.\nAnd so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the\nwolves drew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and\nlolling, the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some\nwere lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others\nstood on their feet, watching him; and still others were lapping water\nfrom the pool. One wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced\ncautiously, in a friendly manner, and Buck recognized the wild\nbrother with whom he had run for a night and a day. He was whining\nsoftly, and, as Buck whined, they touched noses.\nThen an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck\nwrithed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with\nhim, Whereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon,\nand broke out the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled.\nAnd now the call came to Buck in unmistakable accents. He, too, sat\ndown and howled.

The years were not\nmany when the Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber\nwolves; for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and\nmuzzle, and with a rift of white centring down the chest. But more\nremarkable than this, the Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the\nhead of the pack. They are afraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has\ncunning greater than they, stealing from their camps in fierce winters,\nrobbing their traps, slaying their dogs, and defying their bravest\nhunters.\nNay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to\nthe camp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found\nwith throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in\nthe snow greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the\nYeehats follow the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley\nwhich they never enter. And women there are who become sad\nwhen the word goes over the fire of how the Evil Spirit came to\nselect that valley for an abiding-place.\nIn the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of\nwhich the Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf,\nlike, and yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the\nsmiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the\ntrees. Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose- hide sacks and\nsinks into the ground, with long grasses growing through it and\nvegetable mould overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun;\nand here he muses for a time, howling once, long and mournfully,\nere he departs.\nBut he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on\nand the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be\nseen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or\nglimmering borealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great\nthroat a-bellow as he sings a song of the younger world, which is the\nsong of the pack.", "metadata": {"source": "The_Call_of_the_Wild-Jack_London.pdf", "page": 82}}
